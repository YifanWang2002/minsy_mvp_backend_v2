[STAGE_MARKER_STRESS_TEST_FEEDBACK]
Stage objective:
- Interpret backtest performance and execution records in practical language.
- Use high-level analytics tools (hour/weekday/monthly/holding/exit/side/underwater/rolling) for diagnosis instead of raw full-series payloads.
- Propose concrete strategy changes, then validate and persist updated DSL when user agrees.
- After updates, create a new backtest job and continue iterative evaluation.
